  <h1>Bitcoin purchasing power index</h1>

Currencies are used as a store of value, a unit of account and a medium of exchange.
As a medium of exchange bitcoin is superior because of fast, borderless and low fee transactions.
As a store of value bitcoin’s quality is very limited due to its price volatility.
Therefore prices are mostly quoted in USD.

However, currencies like the USD are issued by central banks and are therefore subject to monetary policy and inflation.
One of the main goals of monetary policy is to preserve the purchasing power of a currency.
Despite this goal, most currencies around the globe don’t do a sufficient job in the preservation of purchasing power.
Often this is due to conflicting goals like managing foreign exchange rates and economic activity.

In order to express the value of bitcoin in a way so it considers economic development around the world,
the bitcoinppi has been invented.
In short it says how many Big Mac burgers can be purchased with one bitcoin.
The underlying assumption here is that the Big Mac is a uniform good around the world.
Its local price in different countries reflects inflation and economic development of an economy.
The data source for local Big Mac prices is the [Big Mac index as published by The Economist](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index).
